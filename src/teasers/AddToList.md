## Problem
When we create an array by ```` Arrays.asList() ```` method, the method returns a fix sized list. We can modify members. But, cannot add or delete new members in that list.

## Solution
Never use ```` Arrays.asList() ```` to create a list when you need to add or modify members in that list.
