# Java-Brain-Teasers

## 1. Introduction
This repository is created with intention to add some tricky java codes which can also help us to learn about java more. 

## 2. Purpose
Writing some tricky java classes and their explanations.

## 3. Structure
There will be one ```` .java ```` file where there will be one java class with some trick(s). At class level, there will be a javadoc asking what might be wrong in it. But, the answer will not be there. Cause, I want people to think before jumping to my explanation. 

There will also be a same named ```` .txt or .md ```` file. Explanation will be there. 

## 4. Conclusion
Hope we will have fun together.
